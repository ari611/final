			<div data-aos="zoom-in-up">Gershon, a scholar in anthropology, explains in her book that branding is 'largely a boondoggle advanced by inspirational speakers and job trainers.' However, it doesn’t assist people in getting jobs. Instead, it only makes us more accepting of an increasingly dehumanized job market that treats workers as products rather than people.</div>

			Union memberships have declined, and the average workweek for full-time adults has extended to 47 hours, an increase of 1.5 hours from a decade ago. Today's millennials are experiencing more job changes, averaging four jobs within their first decade after college, which is double the number compared to the previous generation. Modern workplaces are increasingly demanding more time from employees while providing less job security and fewer protections.</div>
